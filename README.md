FuckingFast Link Fetcher is a program that fetches the file URLs from the download pages on "fuckingfast.co". Ideal for downloading games from "fitgirl-repacks.site" where the download page links are stacked on top of each other. Instead of manually downloading each 500Mb part, you can copy the fetched file download URLs and paste it into Internet Download Manager or whatever download manager you are using. Note that FuckingFast allows you to download only a certain amount of files at the same time. If you try to download more than this amount, the server will return "rate limited" and prevent you from downloading files. If that happens, you'll have to reset your router in order to get a new IP. To prevent this from happening, I'd recommend you to set the "Download x files at the same time" setting in your download manager to something arround 6.
